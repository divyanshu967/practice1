# Conway Backend

A secure and scalable logistics enquiry management backend built with **Spring Boot 3**, **Java 21**, **MySQL**, and **JWT Authentication**.

The system enables customers to submit shipment enquiries while providing administrators with a centralized portal to manage enquiries, track activities, monitor analytics, and maintain operational visibility.

## Project Overview

Conway Backend is designed to streamline logistics enquiry management by providing:

* Public enquiry submission for customers
* Admin portal APIs for enquiry management
* Dashboard analytics and reporting
* Notification management
* Audit logging
* Login history tracking
* Role-based access control
* Secure JWT authentication

The backend follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns and database versioning through Flyway migrations.
